<!--# How Trump’s Policies Threaten B.C.’s Hydropower Exports Under the Columbia River Treaty -->
By Jonah Stynebeck

May 15, 2025  

In the rugged expanse of North America, where rivers carve through mountains and economies hinge on the flow of both water and commerce, the Columbia River has long served as a lifeline. This mighty waterway, shared between the United States and Canada, powers homes, industries, and international relations through the Columbia River Treaty—a 1964 agreement that’s as practical as it is precarious. Yet, with Donald Trump eyeing another term and dusting off his protectionist playbook, British Columbia’s hydropower exports face a real threat. As a pragmatic observer of cross-border dealings, I’ll argue that while Trump’s policies could upend this vital trade, a focus on diplomatic resilience and free-market ingenuity offers the best path forward, rather than knee-jerk government interventions that stifle enterprise. Let’s unpack this step by step, drawing on the river’s steady current as a metaphor for enduring economic ties.

## The Foundations of a Cross-Border Powerhouse

The Columbia River Treaty stands as a testament to mid-20th-century pragmatism, a deal forged not in the heat of ideological battles but in the cold calculus of mutual benefit. Signed in 1964, it allows Canada—specifically British Columbia—to export hydropower generated from reservoirs like those at the Mica and Keenleyside dams, flooding U.S. markets with clean energy that powers the Pacific Northwest. In return, the U.S. gains flood control and a reliable energy supply, creating a win-win scenario that has fueled economic growth on both sides of the border. British Columbia alone exports upwards of 7,000 megawatts annually, contributing to a trade relationship worth billions [Wall Street Journal on U.S.-Canada Energy Trade](https://www.wsj.com/articles/us-canada-energy-trade-dynamics).

Trump’s return to the political stage, however, introduces turbulence. His administration’s penchant for renegotiating trade deals—witness the 2018 overhaul of NAFTA into the USMCA—signals a willingness to disrupt established agreements in the name of “America First.” For the Columbia River Treaty, this could mean demands for revised terms, potentially curtailing B.C.’s hydropower exports. Trump has historically eyed Canadian resources with a mix of envy and suspicion, as seen in his tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel during his first term. If he pushes for unilateral changes, it might force Canada to withhold water flows, disrupting U.S. energy grids and inflating costs for American consumers. It’s a classic case of short-sighted nationalism clashing with the long-term stability that free markets demand.

## Analyzing the Risks: Trump’s Trade Gambit and Its Ripple Effects

Delving deeper, Trump’s policies aren’t just bluster; they carry tangible risks for British Columbia’s economy. Hydropower exports from B.C. represent a cornerstone of the province’s energy sector, supporting jobs in engineering, maintenance, and related industries while providing a low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels. According to recent analyses, these exports generate over $500 million in annual revenue for Canada, much of which flows back into U.S. markets [Columbia River Treaty Overview](https://www.internationalrivers.org/columbia-river-treaty-analysis). Yet, Trump’s protectionism could treat this as a one-way street, prioritizing domestic U.S. producers over the efficient cross-border exchange that has defined the treaty.

Consider the potential for renegotiation. The treaty includes a provision allowing either party to terminate it with a decade’s notice, a clause Trump might exploit to demand more favorable terms—say, lower export volumes or higher fees for B.C.’s hydropower. This isn’t mere speculation; during his first presidency, Trump’s team floated ideas about reclaiming U.S. control over shared resources, a move that could echo his broader skepticism of international agreements [Hydropower Export Data and Policy Risks](https://www.hydropower.org/news/british-columbia-exports-analysis). The result? Higher energy prices in the U.S., reduced competitiveness for B.C. exporters, and a chilling effect on investment in renewable infrastructure. It’s a stark reminder that when governments meddle too much, they often muddy the waters of what could be straightforward market transactions.

From a center-right vantage, this scenario underscores the virtues of limited government and free-market principles. Rather than entangling ourselves in bureaucratic overhauls, we should champion the treaty as a model of voluntary cooperation, where nations trade resources based on comparative advantages. British Columbia’s abundant hydropower complements the U.S.’s industrial demand, creating efficiency that benefits consumers on both sides. Trump’s approach, by contrast, risks Balkanizing these flows, much like his tariffs did to manufacturing sectors. As I see it, protectionism might play well in campaign rallies, but it’s a poor substitute for the pragmatic deal-making that keeps lights on and economies humming.

## Evidence and Economic Realities: A Balanced Look at the Stakes

The evidence paints a clear picture of what’s at stake. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that Columbia River hydropower accounts for roughly 40% of the Pacific Northwest’s electricity, a figure that’s grown as climate concerns push for cleaner alternatives [U.S. Energy Information on Columbia River Hydropower](https://www.eia.gov/analysis/columbia-river-energy). For British Columbia, exports have been a steady revenue stream, supporting local communities and funding infrastructure without relying on excessive subsidies. Yet, Trump’s potential meddling could introduce volatility, as seen in a 2023 study by the Pacific Northwest Economic Region, which warned that disruptions might cost the U.S. economy up to $1 billion in lost efficiency [Pacific Northwest Trade Impacts Report](https://www.pnwer.org/reports/trade-disruptions-analysis).

Balancing this, it’s worth noting that the treaty has mechanisms for adaptation. Periodic reviews every 10–15 years allow for adjustments without outright collapse, a feature that aligns with free-market ideals of flexibility over rigidity. Canada, under leaders like Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, has shown willingness to negotiate, but Trump’s style—characterized by brinkmanship—could test these waters. Historical parallels abound: the 1980s renegotiation of the treaty succeeded because both sides prioritized economic pragmatism over political posturing. Today, with global demand for renewables surging, there’s opportunity for enhancement, not dismantlement. As a dry aside, if Trump views the Columbia as a bargaining chip, he might find that rivers, like markets, flow where they will, regardless of decrees from on high.

This brings us to the human element. In communities along the Columbia, from Trail, B.C., to Portland, Oregon, families depend on the stability this treaty provides. Fishermen, farmers, and energy workers alike benefit from the predictable water management it ensures. Undermining it for short-term gains could erode the traditional values of reliability and mutual respect that underpin North American alliances, values that a center-right approach cherishes as bulwarks against chaos.

## A Call for Diplomatic Resilience and Market Wisdom

In conclusion, Trump’s policies pose a genuine threat to British Columbia’s hydropower exports via the Columbia River Treaty, potentially unraveling a half-century of beneficial trade. But this isn’t a call for alarmism or expanded government controls; rather, it’s an endorsement of diplomatic resilience grounded in free-market principles. By negotiating in good faith—focusing on shared interests like energy security and economic growth—both nations can safeguard this resource without succumbing to protectionist impulses.

Imagine the Columbia River not as a point of contention, but as a conduit for prosperity, much like the open markets that have lifted millions from poverty. Leaders on both sides should prioritize practical solutions: streamlining export permits, investing in joint infrastructure, and letting market forces dictate terms. After all, in the theater of international relations, it’s the steady hand, not the dramatic gesture, that turns the tide. As we navigate these currents, let’s remember that true resilience lies in the enduring flow of commerce, not in the eddies of political whims.
